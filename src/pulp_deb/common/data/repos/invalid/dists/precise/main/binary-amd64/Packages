Description: lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library
 libdaemon is a leightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 .
  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process
  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.
