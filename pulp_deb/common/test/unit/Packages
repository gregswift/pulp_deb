Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
 * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
 of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
 efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
 and Pythonic domain language.
 * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
 connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
 instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
 * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
 objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
 structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
 arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
 load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
 commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
 * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
 generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
 for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
 using Unit of Work.
 * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
 rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
 is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
 an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
 ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description: concurrent networking library for Python
 Eventlet allows you to change how you run your code, not how you write it.
 .
 It uses epoll or libevent for highly scalable non-blocking I/O.
 Coroutines ensure that the developer uses a blocking style of programming
 that is similar to threading, but provide the benefits of non-blocking I/O.
 The event dispatch is implicit, which means you can easily use Eventlet from
 the Python interpreter, or as a small part of a larger application.
 .
 It's easy to get started using Eventlet, and easy to convert existing
 applications to use it. Start off by looking at examples, common design
 patterns, and the list of the basic API primitives.

Description: managing cloud instances for Eucalyptus
 EUCALYPTUS is an open source service overlay that implements elastic
 computing using existing resources. The goal of EUCALYPTUS is to allow
 sites with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an
 elastic computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon's EC2.
 .
 Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs
 To Useful Systems - is an open-source software infrastructure for
 implementing "cloud computing" on clusters.  Eucalyptus Systems is the
 pioneer in open source cloud computing technology that delivers hybrid
 cloud deployments for enterprise data centers. Leveraging Linux and web
 service technologies that commonly exist in today's IT infrastructure,
 Eucalyptus enables customers to quickly and easily create elastic clouds
 in minutes. This "no lock-in" approach provides users with ultimate
 flexibility when delivering their SLAs.
 .
 Eucalyptus is more than just virtualization. Along with building virtual
 machines, the technology supports the network and storage infrastructure
 within the cloud environment. Eucalyptus works with multiple flavors
 of Linux including Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Debian, and CentOS. Eucalyptus
 currently supports Xen and KVM hypervisors.  These tools are meant to
 be CLI compatible with the ec2-api-tools.

Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
 * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
 of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
 efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
 and Pythonic domain language.
 * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
 connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
 instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
 * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
 objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
 structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
 arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
 load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
 commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
 * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
 generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
 for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
 using Unit of Work.
 * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
 rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
 is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
 an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
 ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .

 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.

 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its

 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Description: OpenStack Compute - AJAX console proxy - transitional package
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
 EC2 API.
 .
 Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many
 different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends
 (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user
 databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.
 .
 This package used to provide the AJAX proxy, which is now gone.

 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon

 Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many
 different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends
 (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user
 databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.
 .
 This package provides the console server.  This enables the use of consoles
 to be used along with XVP and XenServer.  It is a publically reachable
 component which proxies access to VNCs running on compute nodes.

Description: Quantum is a virtual network service for Openstack - linuxbridge plugin agent
 Quantum is a virtual network service for Openstack, and a part of
 Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically
 request and configure virtual servers, Quantum provides an API to
 dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks
 connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs
 from Nova VMs). The Quantum API supports extensions to provide
 advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,
 etc.)
 .
 This package provides the linuxbridge plugin agent.

Description: fast key-value storage library
 LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that
 provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
 .
 Features:
 * Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.
 * Data is stored sorted by key.
 * Callers can provide a custom comparison function to override
 the sort order.
 * The basic operations are Put(key,value), Get(key), Delete(key).
 * Multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch.
 * Users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of
 data.
 * Forward and backward iteration is supported over the data.
 * Data is automatically compressed using the Snappy compression
 library.
 * External activity (file system operations etc.) is relayed through
 a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system
 interactions.
 * Detailed documentation about how to use the library is included with
 the source code.
 .
 Limitations:
 * This is not a SQL database. It does not have a relational data model,
 it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.
 * Only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a
 particular database at a time.
 * There is no client-server support builtin to the library.
 An application that needs such support will have to wrap their own
 server around the library.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.

 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
 EC2 API.
 .
 Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many
 different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends
 (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user
 databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.
 .
 This package provides the VNC proxy. It is a publically reachable
 component which proxies access to VNCs running on compute nodes.

 new projects, and agents doing data collections should be
 independent of the overall system.

Description: OpenStack Compute - conductor service
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
 EC2 API.
 .
 Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many
 different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends
 (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user
 databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.
 .
 This is the Nova conductor service component
